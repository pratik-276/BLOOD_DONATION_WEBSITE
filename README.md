# BLOOD_DONATION_WEBSITE
This is a website which helps people in need of blood by finding a donor. It also creates awaremess in people and clears away all doubts about blood donation.

The various statistical data used on the website are not owned by me. These data are taken from the websites of World Health Organisation
and Wikipedia.

The video used in the website is also from the World Health Organization (WHO) channel.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the websites:
