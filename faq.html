        <h2>FAQs on Blood Donation</h2><br>
        <div id="qa">
            <p class="qn">What are the minimum requirements to become a blood donor?</p>
            <p class="ans">You must be at least 16 years of age, a minimum of 110 pounds, and in basic good health.</p>
            <p class="qn">Will donating blood hurt?</p>
            <p class="ans">You might feel a slight sting in the beginning lasting only a couple of seconds, but there should be no discomfort during the donation.</p>
            <p class="qn">Are blood donors paid?</p>
            <p class="ans">No. Blood collected for transfusion in the US is collected from volunteer blood donors.</p>
            <p class="qn">Are sterile supplies used?</p>
            <p class="ans">Based on AABB Standards and FDA regulations, all needles, tubing sets, collection bags and other donation supplies are sterile, used once,
                             and discarded in the trash to protect the donor, the transfusion recipient, and the blood donor center staff.</p>
            <p class="qn">How much blood is taken?</p>
            <p class="ans">For a whole blood donation, approximately 500 ml or one-half liter of blood is collected. For donations of other blood products, such as
                             platelet or plasma, the amount collected depends on your height, weight and platelet count.</p>
            <p class="qn">How often may I donate?</p>
            <p class="ans">The Medical Director of each blood donor center is responsible for setting policies regarding the frequency of donation. The policies set
                            by a Medical Director can be more restrictive, permitting donation less frequently than permitted by AABB Standards and FDA regulations. Based on AABB
                            and FDA requirements, you must wait 56 days between whole blood donations. Platelet (apheresis) donors may donate more frequently. This is because the body
                             replenishes platelets and plasma more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within about 72 hours of donating. Plasma (the liquid
                              portion of your blood) will return to normal levels within a couple of days. </p>
            <p class="qn">Is there such thing as artificial blood?</p>
            <p class="ans">Scientists have yet to find a successful substitute for human blood. This is why blood donors are so vital to the lives of those who are in need of blood.</p>
            <p class="qn">What fees are associated with blood?</p>
            <p class="ans">There are significant costs associated with collecting, testing, preparing components, labeling, storing and shipping blood; recruiting and educating donors;
                 and quality assurance. As a result, processing fees are charged to recover those costs. Processing fees for individual blood components vary. Hospitals alos charge for
                  any additional testing that may be required, such as the crossmatch,
                             as well as for the administration of the blood.</p>
            <p class="qn">Is there anything I should do before I donate?</p>
            <p class="ans">Be sure to eat well at your regular mealtimes and drink plenty of fluids before and after donation.</p>
            <p class="qn">If I have a cold or the flu, can I donate blood?</p>
            <p class="ans">No, blood blood centers require that you be in good health (symptom-free) and feeling well.</p>
            <p class="qn">How long will the actual donation process take?</p>
            <p class="ans">The entire donation process, from registration to post-donation refreshments, takes about one hour. The actual donation takes about 5-10 minutes.</p>
            <p class="qn">How will I feel after I donate?</p>
            <p class="ans">Most people tolerate blood donation very well. However, some people experience fatigue. You should discuss your concerns before and after donation with a
                 staff member at the blood donor center or blood drive.</p>
            <p class="qn">If I was deferred once before, am I still ineligible to donate?</p>
            <p class="ans">Your blood donor center will inform you if you are permanently deferred or temporarily deferred. The deferral time depends upon the reason for deferral.
                 Prior to each donation, you will be given a mini-physical and medical interview. At that time, it will be determined if you are eligible to donate blood on that
                  day.</p>
